## Usage

Click the 'BEGIN!' button to start the quiz. You will have 30 seconds to answer five multiple-choice questions. Click one of the purple buttons to choose that as your answer. Answering a question will make all of the buttons turn gray; if you are correct, the button you clicked will turn green. Otherwise, it will turn red, and the correct answer will be highlighted in green. You can then click the 'Submit' button, which should now be purple, to advance to the next question. Repeat this until you reach the results screen, either by the timer or by completing the quiz. At the results screen, you can input your name to save your score to the local storage. Afterwards, you can view your high scores. Click the 'Go Back' button to return the start screen, or click the 'Clear High Scores' to erase your existing high scores. Azzi's score cannot be erased, and is there by default.
